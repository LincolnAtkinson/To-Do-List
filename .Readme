This is a To-Do list where you can create multiple lists. You can edit each list item,
and delete them as well. To reorganize your lists all you have to do is drag and drop your
items in the order that you want them to be. It is very simple to use and if you want to reset
your storage all you have to do is press the keys z,p, and g, all at once. That is all you really,
have to know to get started.
